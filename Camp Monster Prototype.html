As soon as we arrived in Joe&#x27;s truck, we knew something was wrong. The cabin&#x27;s front windows were broken and the door was ajar. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t the best idea, but we all split up to look around the cabin to try to figure out what had happened. Eventually, we all met inside to report our findings. 

&quot;There&#x27;s no food in the cupboards,&quot; said Gabby.

&quot;The windows were broken from the outside,&quot; said Marvin.

&quot;The generator is busted,&quot; said Rebecca, &quot;We don&#x27;t have electricity.&quot;

&quot;I found some tire tracks outside,&quot; said Joe, &quot;Looks it came from a sedan.&quot;

&quot;We should go,&quot; said Gabby, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel safe here.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ll get the car ready,&quot; said Joe on his way out the front door.

What do you think?

[[&quot;Yeah let&#x27;s get out of here.&quot;|BeginningGo]]

&quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea,&quot; says Marvin.

&quot;For all we know the guy or bear that got into our cabin is still around here somewhere,&quot; says Gabby. &quot;He could be violent!&quot;

&quot;I agree,&quot; says Rebecca. &quot;Let&#x27;s get out of here as soon as we can.&quot;

Before you have time to respond, you hear Joe yell &quot;Oh shit!&quot; loudly outside.

The room erupts in confusion and protest. &quot;We just filled it up on our way here!&quot; shouts Marvin.

&quot;What&#x27;s the gas mileage on that thing?&quot; says Rebecca.

&quot;It&#x27;s not that low!&quot; says Joe. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened, but we&#x27;re stuck here.&quot;

There is a moment of silence as everyone considers the awful situation they are in. Eventually Gabby speaks up. &quot;This is your cabin, Marvin. Isn&#x27;t there somewhere around here we could go?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, there&#x27;s a **hunting cabin** nearby!&quot; says Marvin. &quot;There should be plenty of **guns** there we can arm ourselves with!&quot;

&quot;What about **food**?&quot; says Rebecca. &quot;We don&#x27;t have anything to eat, I think that should be our top priority.&quot;

&quot;Well there&#x27;s actually **bunker** nearby that&#x27;s supposed to be stocked for five years,&quot; says Marvin. &quot;But the guy who owns it is kinda crazy.&quot;

It sounds like a time to chime in. What do you think?

&quot;It doesn&#x27;t have to be everyone,&quot; says Marvin. He looks at you. &quot;We can protect the group by ourselves.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m going with you, Marvin&quot; says Joe nodding at Gabby. You sense a closeness between them.

&quot;Fine,&quot; says Rebecca. Gabby and I will go get food from the bunker.&quot;

Rebecca scoffs. &quot;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re taking this seriously!&quot; she says.

&quot;It won&#x27;t be safe with all of us swinging guns around,&quot; says Gabby.

&quot;There should be some tools or boards we can improvise weapons with,&quot; says Joe. &quot;Food&#x27;s gonna be a lot harder to find.&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe you&#x27;re right,&quot; says Marvin. He looks at you. &quot;Sorry, but I think the people have spoken.&quot;

The group indeed appears agreed. Everyone is getting ready to head to the bunker.

&quot;I won&#x27;t care if whoever did this comes back!&quot; says Marvin. &quot;I want a weapon!&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s safe,&quot; says Gabby. &quot;Should we really all be carrying guns around?&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m coming too, Marvin&quot; says Joe.

&quot;Fine,&quot; says Rebecca. &quot;Gabby and I will go get food from the bunker.&quot;

It&#x27;s your turn to speak.

[[&quot;No. We all have to stick together&quot;|StickTogether]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="PJMGuns,RGFood" tags="" position="599,596">The group has decided to split up. Marvin gave directions to Rebecca and Gabby to the bunker. He leads the way for you and Joe to get to the hunting cabin.

It&#x27;s a long walk with several twists and turns, on and off the trail. &quot;Do you know where you&#x27;re taking us?&quot; says Joe.

&quot;No, I&#x27;m getting you both lost so I can devour you when the time is right,&quot; says Marvin. Joe grabs Marvin by the collar and Marvin flails around. &quot;Geez!&quot; says Marvin, &quot;I&#x27;m trying to lighten the mood, okay?&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#x27;re doing a shitty job,&quot; says Joe, releasing him.

Soon after, the cabin comes into view. Vines, leaves, and brush cover the ground around it.

&quot;When was the last time someone came here?&quot; says Joe.

&quot;You should be happy,&quot; says Marvin, grabbing the door handle. &quot;At least the guy who trashed our cabin didn&#x27;t do the same here.&quot; He pulls on the handle but the door won&#x27;t budge. &quot;Aw, crap.&quot;

You and Marvin search for a key while Joe tries to break the door down. You hear the door blast open, but as you and Marvin head into the hunter&#x27;s cabin, Joe comes out, blocking the entrance.

&quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot; asks Marvin.

&quot;We&#x27;re going back to your cabin, Marvin&quot; says Joe. One of his arms is behind his back.

&quot;Yeah, I know, can I get a weapon first?&quot; says Marvin.

&quot;We&#x27;re going back NOW!&quot; says Joe. He reveals a pistol that he&#x27;s been holding.

Marvin moves towards Joe and Joe fires a shot. Marvin twirls around and falls, yelling &quot;Are you freaking kidding me!?&quot; He appears unharmed. &quot;You could have killed me!&quot;

&quot;Calm down and start walking,&quot; says Joe. Marvin grumbles and turns around. You all start heading back in the direction you came from.

&quot;You&#x27;re right,&quot; says Rebecca. &quot;It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve eaten. If whoever did this comes back, we need the energy to fight!&quot;

&quot;Who needs energy when you have guns?&quot; says Marvin.

&quot;It&#x27;s not just about fighting,&quot; says Joe. &quot;We need to be on the lookout. Someone needs to stay up at night and keep watch.&quot;

&quot;Well, why don&#x27;t we split up?&quot; says Marvin. &quot;I&#x27;ll get the guns and you guys can get the food!&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m fine with that,&quot; says Rebecca.

&quot;I don&#x27;t know...&quot; says Gabby.

&quot;I&#x27;ll go get the guns with you,&quot; says Joe. &quot;No one should be out here alone.&quot;

Gabby nods, saying &quot;They aren&#x27;t even ours! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to steal guns.&quot;

&quot;This is an emergency!&quot; yells Marvin. &quot;Desperate times call for desperate measures!&quot;

&quot;Calm down Marvin,&quot; says Joe. We need to think this through. Don&#x27;t you think the guy who raided our cabin might have raided the hunter&#x27;s cabin too?&quot;

The room falls silent as the room considers this thought.

&quot;We have to do something right now,&quot; says Rebecca. &quot;We can&#x27;t fall into hopelessness.&quot;

&quot;Let&#x27;s just get the food. I don&#x27;t even want to think about this,&quot; says Marvin.

&quot;I don&#x27;t care how hungry I am if that guy&#x27;s gonna come back and stab me,&quot; says Marvin. &quot;I want to be ready.&quot;

&quot;We don&#x27;t need guns to be ready,&quot; says Joe. &quot;We need to be alert. We need someone keeping guard at night. And we need to trust each other.&quot; Joe&#x27;s expression has turned serious, and he turns to you. &quot;Go with Gabby and Rebecca to get food. Marvin and I will grab weapons.&quot;

Joe&#x27;s words have had a profound effect on the room. What do you think?

Marvin and Joe head to the hunting cabin. You, Rebecca, and Gabby head to the bunker for food, following a hand-drawn map Marvin gave you.

No one has much to say on the walk. You keep an eye on the trees around you, but fail to notice anything suspicious. Eventually the trail leads to a small clearing with a hole in the ground.

Inspecting the hole, you see a ladder going down about 10 feet. You draw the short stick and Rebecca and Gabby watch as you clamber down the ladder. Reaching the bottom, you see a vault door. It&#x27;s locked, so you knock on it.

&quot;GO AWAY!&quot; yells a voice from inside the bunker. &quot;GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot;

Before you have a chance to respond, you hear a scream from above.

No one offers a rebuttal.
